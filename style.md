# Headings

Headings should have each word capitalised.  
Short articles do not need any specific heading structure.  

# Line Breaks

All lines should have a forced newline at their end so

```
.__
^ full stop
 ^^ spacebars
```

.

# Compilation

Examples should be self contained.  
It should be possible to copy and paste the example and immediately compile.
